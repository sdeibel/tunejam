    ** Next/previous buttons on event set pages
    ** Try to fix so it works better on devices
    ** Authoring of tunes on the dev page  
    ** Embedded audio player on same page -- use http://jplayer.org/latest/demo-05/
    ** Add a site version number in footer
    ** Easier selection by typed fragments to quickly make sets (do OR on each word)
  ** Content
    ** Email all the local authors to check history
    ** Arranged bumblebee is missing C part in notes + both versions need grace notes not trills
    ** Entirely missing tunes
      ** The rest of my own tunes

* Website Phase Four+
  * Improve ability to create live-updating event page
    * Per-event passwords to prevent edit/deletion by others + on set creation
      require entering the set password + some sort of captcha -- if not pw entered,
      generate one
    * A way to rename or duplicate the event
    * A way to sort sets in the event
    - A way to name sets
    - A way to indicate a missing song (not in database)
  * Clean up
    * Remove old saved sets impl
    * Remove old unused doc generation code
    * Book impls could share more code
    * error() shouldn't exit but instead show meaningful error to user
  * Allow setting event expiration date (default to 1 month)
  * A way to select tunes by length in measures
  * In books:  Optional matrix for know/at-speed/can-start/harmonies check rectangle
  * A way to play the chords at a set tempo and/or metronome?
  * A way to play set recordings in order one after the other and/or w/ repeat?
  * A way to play recordings slowed down (record speed in DB so can show
    approx beats/minute)
  * Statistics-guided set creation
    * Also remember times played for each tune
    * Randomly select tunes based on time played -- mix well-known and less known
    * Allow specifying existing sets or all of site as the basis for random sets
    * Load set as provisional and only mark as played if save to event
       (but still mark the individual tunes as played)
    * Avoid generating sets identical to existing (ignoring order of tunes)
  * Find notebooks/bindings/printing options for flip books
