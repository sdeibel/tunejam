* Website Phase Two
  ** Reorganization
    ** Edit all tunes to add new A, O, C, #, H, U, and S data where appropriate
       To do: C+
    ** Review category for all tunes; move them all to db and use
       only C: tune class attrib; allow multiple classes comma-separated
       for example 'reel,hornpipe'
    ** Arranged bumblebee is missing C part in notes + both versions need grace notes
       not trills
    ** Add the rest of my own tunes
    ** Host full written tunes on site when in tunes dir and link automatically from tune page
    ** Option to include meta data in sets, events, and books
  ** Authoring of tunes on the dev page
  ** May want to have random/least-recent set selection be provisional and
     only record stats if user confirms it
  ** Statistics guided set creation
    ** Also remember times played for each tune
    ** Randomly select tunes based on time played -- mix well-known and less known
    ** Allow specifying existing sets or all of site as the basis for random sets
    ** Load set as provisional and only mark as played if save to session
       (but still mark the individual tunes as played)
    ** Avoid generating sets identical to existing (ignoring order of tunes)
  ** Try to fix so it works better on devices
  ** Set up Tune Jam session with our common sets
* Website Phase Three+
  * Ability to create live-updating session page to sync devices
    * Per-session passwords to prevent edit/deletion by others + on set creation
      require entering the set password + some sort of captcha -- if not pw entered,
      generate one
    * A way to rename or duplicate the session
    * A way to sort sets in the session
    - A way to name sets
    - A way to indicate a missing song (not in database)
  * Embedded audio player on same page -- use http://jplayer.org/latest/demo-05/
