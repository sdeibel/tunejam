* Website Phase One
  * Ability to create live-updating session page to sync devices
  * A way to generate random sets matching the filters
  * A way to select tunes by length in measures
  * Easier way to move to next tune/set when don't fit on screen
  * Improve saved sets
    * Clean up URLs for sets and operating on sets
    * Fix editing sets by only changing order (doesn't record changes for some reason)
    * Fix editing to preload title/subtitle and so same set is updated rather than
      creating a new one -- use file names based on title instead
    * Captcha or access control to prevent bots from creating sets
  * Book generation improvements
    * Flip book variant (three of same tune)
    * Optional matrix for know/at-speed/can-start/harmonies check rectangle
  * Browser issues
    * Opera sizing completely wrong -- rework how sizing is done (e.g. use the PNG
      of the tune instead of SVG)
    * Chrome forgets selected tunes when go back to page
  * Design / header / footer / menu / improve overall CSS
  * Review/improve URL structure
* Website Phase Two+
  * Remove old unused doc generation code
  * Embedded audio player on same page?
  * A way to play the chords at a set tempo and/or metronome?
  * A way to play set recordings in order one after the other and/or w/ repeat?
  * A way to play recordings slowed down (record speed in DB so can show
    approx beats/minute)
* Find notebooks/bindings/printing options for flip books
* More tunes for which we have recordings but no card
