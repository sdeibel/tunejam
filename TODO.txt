* Website Phase Two
  ** Add to sessions ability to say "playing this now" and to get at dates played
     for each set and sort by date last played + show counts for number of times played; 
     want to store dates played for each tune so set date is last date played together
  ** Add suggest feature to sessions
    ** Randomly select tunes into sets (of selected type or same type randomly or any 
       type) -- want algorithm that mixes well-known and less recently played to
       always bring back past tunes
    ** Randomly select sets -- same algorithm base on set times
    ** Allow specifying sets or all of site as the basis for suggestions
    ** Generate sets and set current as for existing functionality but don't
       store the sets permanently in the session; just store list of times played
  ** Try to fix so it works better on devices
  ** Set up Tune Jam session with our common sets
