* Website Phase Three
  ** Coding
    ** Generate playable midi with music21.  For example:
        import os
        from music21 import converter
        score = converter.parse('/Users/sdeibel/abc/src/tunes/mountain_ash.abc')
        fn = score.write('midi')
        os.system('open {}'.format(fn))    
        (or feed midi into a js midi player or let browser open it)
    ** Fix sets page for mobile devices (also can list same thing twice
       when search + do "random 3")
    ** Clean up notes/print/abc/play icon code by centralizing
    ** Add play icon on the ABC page
    ** Add some photos?  home, local, events, sessions, others?
    ** Are PDF chords working for odd tunes like Arran Boat, Bear Dance I, and
       Snowy Path?
    ** Split up PDF sheet music for long tunes like Dublin Gypsy into multiple pages
    ** Option to include meta data in sets, events, and books
    ** Next/previous buttons on event set pages
    ** Try to fix so it works better on devices
    ** Authoring of tunes on the dev page  
    ** Embedded audio player on same page -- use http://jplayer.org/latest/demo-05/
       Or use Web Audio API in html5:  https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/JRaLVR
       https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/
    ** Ability to convert abc to midi wih https://ifdo.ca/~seymour/runabc/top.html
       (download link is hard to see; buried as "The latest version is abcMIDI-2020.02.12.zip")
       and play it with https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js/ or similar
    ** Easier selection by typed fragments to quickly make sets (do OR on each word)
  ** Content
    ** Complete the partial listings and add missing recordings and sheet music
    ** Entirely missing tunes
      ** My other tunes
        ** Janvrin's Island
        ** White creek trout are jumping
        ** Mr Ernest Hillier aka Two Goats Jig
        ** Isolation Jig
      ** January waltz (can't find this anywhere)
      ** Others? - All the recent ones (need to see Bliss's notebook)
* Website Phase Four+
  * Improve ability to create live-updating event page
    * Per-event passwords to prevent edit/deletion by others + on set creation
      require entering the set password + some sort of captcha -- if not pw entered,
      generate one
    * A way to rename or duplicate the event
    * A way to sort sets in the event
    - A way to name sets
    - A way to indicate a missing song (not in database)
  * Clean up
    * Remove old saved sets impl
    * Remove old unused doc generation code
    * Book impls could share more code
    * error() shouldn't exit but instead show meaningful error to user
  * Allow setting event expiration date (default to 1 month)
  * A way to select tunes by length in measures
  * In books:  Optional matrix for know/at-speed/can-start/harmonies check rectangle
  * A way to play the chords at a set tempo and/or metronome?
  * A way to play set recordings in order one after the other and/or w/ repeat?
  * A way to play recordings slowed down (record speed in DB so can show
    approx beats/minute)
  * Statistics-guided set creation
    * Also remember times played for each tune
    * Randomly select tunes based on time played -- mix well-known and less known
    * Allow specifying existing sets or all of site as the basis for random sets
    * Load set as provisional and only mark as played if save to event
       (but still mark the individual tunes as played)
    * Avoid generating sets identical to existing (ignoring order of tunes)
  * Find notebooks/bindings/printing options for flip books
