* Website Phase One
  ** Collect and add author information as separate line in the .specs or add to titles
  ** Fix page cache to not share pages between books and PDFs from the sets page (header
     and page number differs) -- see if removing page cache matters (most of the time may
     be saved in the tune cache)
  ** Fix breakage of site when get exceptions on broken pipe:
      Traceback (most recent call last):

    error: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
    (although it also breaks w/o this, apparently when using Safari on OS X 10.9.5)
  ** Can't play tunes in Safari on OS X 10.9.5 -- need file extension? (works on 10.10)
  ** Move all js packages to local server
  ** Ability to create live-updating session page to sync devices
    ** Add new /session page w/ list of sessions
    ** A way to create a session page (needs captcha or similar) + set page owner pw + 
       store cookie so don't usually need pw
    ** A way for owner to add sets to the page w/ existing disabled saved set functionality
    ** A way to set the current set for page, which then syncs to devices
    ** A way to set non-saved set from sets page as current (maybe saves as it goes
       so there is a record)
    * A way to delete sets out of a session
    * A way to sort sets in the session
    * A way to clone a session
    * A way to delete a session
  ** Improve saved sets and re-enable in context of session pages
    ** Clean up URLs for sets and operating on sets
    ** Fix editing sets by only changing order (doesn't record changes for some reason)
    * Fix editing to preload title/subtitle and so same set is updated rather than
      creating a new one -- use file names based on title instead
  * Browser issues
    * Opera sizing completely wrong -- rework how sizing is done (e.g. use the PNG
      of the tune instead of SVG)
    * Chrome forgets selected tunes when go back to page
  * Design / header / footer / menu / improve overall CSS
  * Review/improve URL structure
* Website Phase Two+
  * A way to select tunes by length in measures
  * Book generation improvements
    * Optional matrix for know/at-speed/can-start/harmonies check rectangle
  * Easier selection by typed fragments to quickly make sets  
  * Easier way to move to next tune/set when don't fit on screen
  * Remove old unused doc generation code
  * Embedded audio player on same page?
  * A way to play the chords at a set tempo and/or metronome?
  * A way to play set recordings in order one after the other and/or w/ repeat?
  * A way to play recordings slowed down (record speed in DB so can show
    approx beats/minute)
* Find notebooks/bindings/printing options for flip books
* More tunes for which we have recordings but no card [p=added placeholder listing]
