* Website Phase One
  * Enter new cards from Bliss
  * Generate each tune with abc2ps -g (one SVG file per tune) and combine 
    into single file with reportlab so can position/size chords correctly; 
    refine chords and layout/look
    Can read SVG with 'drawing = svg2rlg(svgFilePath)' (obtained from 
    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/svg2rlg/)
  * Book generation -- selected tunes or all tunes; flip book or not
  * Browser issues
    * Opera sizing completely wrong -- rework how sizing is done?
    * Chrome forgets selected tunes when go back to page
  * Cut apart other recordings in recordings-to-sort dir
  * Design / header / footer / menu / improve overall CSS
  * Review/improve URL structure
* Website Phase Two+
  * Print book index and TOC
  * Embedded audio player on same page?
  * Fix changing filter to not clear the selected items (do it client side)
  * Add text filter field to sets page
  * Add key selector to sets page
  * A way to generate random sets matching the filters
  * A way to save set to a sets page
  * A way to play the chords at a set tempo and/or metronome?
  * A way to play set recordings in order one after the other and/or w/ repeat?
  * A way to play recordings slowed down (record speed in DB so can show
    approx beats/minute)
  * A way to share sets pages w/ live update for group playing (define
    event and have a live update url to sync devices)
  * Printable version optionally could have boxes to check for "know",
    "at dance tempo", "can start", etc
* Notebooks/printing options for flip books
* More tunes for which we have recordings
