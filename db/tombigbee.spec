O:USA - South
A:Traditional
H:The Tombigbee is a river in Mississippi and Alabama.  The name comes from a Choctaw 
H:word meaning "box maker" or "coffin maker."  This tune was used as the melody for a 
H:song named Gum Tree Canoe that seems to describe the romance and serendipitous
H:escape of two cotton field slaves.  Although this tune originated in the mid 19th 
H:century in the southern US, it has been adopted and played in many other traditions,
H:as far away as Australia.
