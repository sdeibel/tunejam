T:Wedding on the Hill
C:waltz
O:USA - Cambridge NY
A:Bonnie Epstein
H:This waltz was written by harpist Bonnie Epstein, at the time a resident of
H:Greenwich NY, to be played at the wedding of a friend.  She explains its 
H:origin as follows: "This tune was written on Meriden Hill in Columbia, New Hampshire, 
H:for a cousin's wedding. The wedding was held outside at his cabin in the woods,
H:with forty people and nine very large dogs attending. As the ceremony was starting, a 
H:guest had an epileptic seizure. The paramedics arrived but refused to get out
H:of their car until all of the dogs were put into the house. So the dogs and I went in,
H:all vying for a spot by the window. The guest was fine and when I was given the 
H:"all clear" I opened the cabin door and out raced the dogs, like a tidal wave. The
H:wedding on the hill continued but the tune was never played that day!"
