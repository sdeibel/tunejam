T:Manx Waltz #1 (Arrane Ghelby)
C:waltz
O:Isle of Man
A:Faeries
H:This tune is named Arrane Ghelby, which means Song of Dalby, after a place on the West
H:coast of the Isle of Man, where the tune was first heard. Another name for it is Song of
H:the Kelpie (a shape-shifting water spirit). The origin of the tune is attributed to a
H:mysterious man in a curiously shaped boat that would appear at the close of summer
H:evenings off Niarbyl Point by Dalby. He sang this song, and while the words could not be
H:understood the locals learned the tune and passed it down. Locals believe variously that
H:the man was a fisherman or a member of the mooinjer veggy, the little people or faeries.
H:The tune is usually played with Manx Waltz #2 (Ushag Veg Ruy) as a break in the middle.
