T:Willafjord
C:reel
O:Canada - Inuit
A:Traditional
H:Although often said to have been composed by Shetland fiddler Tom Anderson, in his book
H:Hand Me Doon da Fiddle (1979) he wrote that it was was brought back from the Greenland
H:whaling expeditions. F. Wilkins in a 2017 article in Folk Music Journal stated that Cree
H:fiddle players in the town of Moose Factory in northern Ontario recognised it as an Inuit
H:melody. A tune called Log Cabin, written by fiddler James Stewart of Chisasibi on Hudson
H:Bay, appears to be based on it. Willafjord is played in Newfoundland and Cape Breton using
H:the same bow strokes as in Shetland. Tom Anderson likened the tune's rhythm to walking
H:with one foot in a ditch.
