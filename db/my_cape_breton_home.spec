A:Jerry Holland
O:Canada - Cape Breton
H:This tune was composed in 1988 as a slow air by fiddler Jerry Holland (1955-2009), who lived in
H:Inverness on Cape Breton. The tune was written for his father, to commemorate their shared
H:love of Cape Breton. The author stated that he wanted to give the tune a different name,
H:but a friend wrote lyrics to the melody and called it "My Cape Breton Home", so he stuck
H:with that title.
