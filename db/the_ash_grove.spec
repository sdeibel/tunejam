T:The Ash Grove
C:waltz
K:G
A:Unknown
O:Wales
H:Authorship of this tune is uncertain, but it is primarily of Welsh origin. It may
H:originally have been based on a composition by Turlough O'Carolan called Beauty in Tears,
H:and it was certainly in O'Carolan's repertoire. However, Beauty in Tears may also have
H:been written by John Parry, a Welsh harpist. The confusion may stem from the fact that
H:both Parry and O'Carolan were blind harpists living in the first part of the 18th century.
H:The tune may in fact be much older, since it also resembles a tune called Constant Billy
H:that was published in Playford's Dancing Master in 1665.
