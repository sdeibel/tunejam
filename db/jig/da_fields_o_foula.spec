T:Da Fields o' Foula (Flowers of May)
C:jig
O:Shetland
A:Traditional
H:Although it is a jig, this tune is often played as part of a set to dance The Foula Reel.  
H:Aly Bain allegedly commented that the Shetlanders didnâ€™t 
H:know the difference, but it is also possible they use an older meaning to "reel," namely
H:as a general term for "dance."
