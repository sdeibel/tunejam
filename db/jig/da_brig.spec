C:jig
A:John Stickle
O:Shetland
H:Although it is a jig, this tune is often played as part of a set to dance The Foula Reel,
H:which of course is also a jig.  Aly Bain allegedly commented that the Shetlanders didnâ€™t 
H:know the difference, but more likely they are using an older meaning to "reel," namely
H:as a general term for "dance."  The John Stickle (1875-1957) that wrote this tune was a 
H:descendent of Fredamann Stickle (1794-1867), who wrote other famous Shetland tunes, 
H:including Christmas Day Ida Mournin'.
