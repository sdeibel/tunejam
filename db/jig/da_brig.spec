T:Da Brig
C:jig
A:Friedamann Stickle
O:Shetland
H:This tune is often attributed to John Stickle (1875-1957, but was actually written by his ancestor
H:Friedemann Stickle (1794-1867).  Pat Shuldham-Shaw recorded this origin as follows:  ""One evening 
H:as Friedemann Stickle was sitting at his home in Burrafirth in the north of Unst, 
H:a brigantine in full sail sailed right across the mouth of the voe (a kind of minature 
H:fjord). The sight of it inspired him to take down his fiddle and compose this tune 
H:which has been preserved in his family every since."
H:Although it is a jig, this tune is often played as part of a set to dance The Foula Reel,
H:which of course is also really a jig.  Aly Bain allegedly commented that the Shetlanders 
H:didnâ€™t know the difference, but more likely they are using an older meaning to "reel," 
H:namely as a general term for "dance."
