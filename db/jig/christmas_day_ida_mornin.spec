T:Christmas Day Ida Moarnin'
C:jig
A:Friedemann Stickle
O:Shetland
H:The author was a famous Shetland fiddler in the 18th and early 19th century, and used to
H:play this tune every Christmas morning in the hall of his laird, the Laird of Buness.
H:Shetland fiddler, collector, and teacher Tom Anderson (1910â€“1991) stated that
H:Friedemann had composed the tune on the road from his croft (tenant farm) at Burrafirth to
H:Buness.  He also remembered that Stickle was called 'Stumpie' because he walked with a
H:limp, and thought it possible that the tune's rhythm reflects the rhythm of Stickle's walk.
H:According to Bliss McIntosh, who studied in the Shetland Islands in the 1970's, this tune
H:would be played for the laird at Christmas and whoever played it best would win a free
H:year's rent for their croft.
