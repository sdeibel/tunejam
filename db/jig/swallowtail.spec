T:Swallowtail
C:jig
O:Ireland
A:Traditional
H:The title may refer to a type of coat with tails that was worn by early 19th century
H:dancing master, so it may date from around that time. The first printed version is from
H:the mid 19th century. This jig serves as a vehicle for Northumbrian sword dancing, and
H:apparently also a fair amount of snobbery about whether it is too simple to be played in a
H:session.
