T:Garster's Dream
C:jig
A:Trowie
H:This is a Trowie (Fairy) tune from the Shetland Island of Fetlar ('the fat isle'). It
H:was heard by a man named Garster, coming from a hole in the ground while he was resting by
H:a Trowie Knoll (Fairy Hill) on his way home from a wedding. He attributed the tune to the
H:trows, the islandâ€™s version of Scandinavian trolls, but others scroff and say he must 
H:have fallen asleep and dreamt it (hence the name)
