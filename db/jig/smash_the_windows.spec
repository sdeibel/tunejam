T:Smash the Windows
C:jig
O:Unknown
A:Traditional
H:This melody first appeared in a manuscript copybook from 1780 to 1804 that was written
H:by John Fife, a fiddler who was possibly from Perthshire, Scotland.  He traveled at sea
H:during the time in which he worked on this copybook, so the tune may also have originated
H:from another area.  Someone once communicated to me that the tune was about the 1917 Halifax
H:explosion, although it clearly very much predates that event and I cannot now find any 
H:reference for this claim.
