T:Haste to the Wedding
C:jig
O:England
A:Unknown
H:The tune was introduced under the name "Come, Haste to the Wedding" in the pantomime The
H:Elopement staged in London in 1767. However, it also appeared under the title "The Small
H:Pin Cushion" in cellist-composer James Oswald's Caledonian Pocket Companion, Book 10
H:(London, 1760) and other publications that predate the pantomime. Oswalds may have been
H:its composer, but its ultimate provenance remains unclear. The tune arrived in the New
H:World soon afterwards, as evidenced by its inclusion in a 1778 notebook of a Boston
H:fiddler who had been an officer in the Continental Army.
