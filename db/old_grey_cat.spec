T:Old Grey Cat
C:reel,polka
O:Ireland
A:Traditional
H:This tune may also be of Scottish provenance, but printings only go as far back
H:as the 1880's, where it was listed as an Irish tune.  It is not in the Great Highland 
H:Bagpipe repertoire, so an Irish provenance seems more likely.  It is also known as 
H:Smugglers Reel.
