A:Traditional
O:Ireland
H:This is a polka from Munster that is also known as The Green Cottage Polka.  Because it has
H:a long history, documented through earlier forms in print, it serves as a great
H:example of the "folk process" over several centuries. In order of age: (1) The Raw
H:Recruit or Abraham’s Daughter was a stage song during the American Civil War era that
H:was published in Winner’s New Primer for Violin in 1862. (2) St. Patrick Was A Gentleman
H:was published in 1841 in John Clinton's Gems of Ireland: 200 Airs. (3) The American shape
H:note hymn Mecklinburg was printed in a supplement to the Kentucky Harmony around 1815,
H:where it was attributed to someone named Lowry. (4) The Scottish strathspey Mrs Wemyss of
H:Cuttlehill was published in Niel Gow’s 3rd Collection of 1792.
