T:Stool of Repentance
C:jig
O:Scotland
A:Traditional
H:The title may refer to a seat used in Scottish Presbyterian churches to shame people who
H:had committed moral crimes such as adultery or becoming pregnant when unmarried. Since the
H:tune is very jolly it may also be a reference to a parlor game of the same name, where
H:participants write or say something about a player that then tries to guess who made each
H:statement. Or, it may refer to Jenny Geddis throwing a stool at the minister of St Giles
H:Kirk in Edinburgh in 1637, in protest of the new Scottish Episcopal Book of Common Prayer.
H:This is said to have sparked the riot that led to the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. An early
H:version of this melody appears in manuscripts in 1733 and 1734. It is also known as
H:Wrights Rant and Joiners Jig.
