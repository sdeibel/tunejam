T:Driving the Turkeys to Boston
C:reel
A:Caz Lewis
O:USA - Cambridge NY
H:This tune was written in 2014 by Cambridge NY recorder and whistle player Caz Lewis
H:It was inspired by a Vermont Edition radio show that described the
H:19th century practice of driving turkeys from Vermont to Boston. Farmers would group
H:their flocks  together, to drive at least 1,000 and often 7,000-10,000 turkeys at a time. 
H:Progress was limited to 10-15 miles per day and about 10% of the turkeys would be lost
H:along the way to foxes, drowning in rivers, and theft. Sometimes the turkeys' feet would be
H:dipped in warm tar to create a protective coating, in order to make them less prone to
H:soreness. At night and on dark days the turkeys would stop walking and refuse to continue.
H:Inside a long covered bridge they could stop until they were carried out into the sun
H:again. At night they would roost wherever they were located, in such numbers that they 
H:caused the collapse of buildings.
