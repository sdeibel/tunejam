T:The Empty Nest
C:air,waltz
O:Cape Breton
A:Ashley MacIsaac
H:This tune was written by Cape Breton fiddler Ashley MacIsaac in January 2021.  It was
H:a birthday gift for Stephan Deibel, commissioned by his lovely wife Gina.  The tune 
H:commemorates their abrupt and long-lasting transition to empty-nester 
H:status when their daughter left for college and was unable to return home due to the 
H:Covid pandemic of 2020 and 2021.  The original video recording of the tune, linked
H:below, was unfortunately truncated in transmission, at just after the halfway mark.
