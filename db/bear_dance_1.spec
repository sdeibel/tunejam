T:Bear Dance #1
C:march
K:Am
A:Traditional
O:France - Brittany
H:This is the first part of a tune called Krebbel in Belgium, although it may have older 
H:eastern European or Gypsy roots.  The low A at the end of the B part, which notably
H:has only 7 bars, is almost certainly intended to be the growling of the bear.
H:Locally, this tune is played before Bear Dance #2,
H:but elsewhere the order is sometimes reversed.  Some local groups play a different 
H:subset, consisting of the A part of Bear Dance #2 followed the A part of Bear 
H:Dance #1.  There is also a third Bear Dance that serves as an introduction and 
H:tag ending, and many other similar versions of part of all of these tunes.
