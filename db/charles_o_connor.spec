O:Ireland
H:This tune is named for Charles O'Conor (1710â€“1791), who was an antiquarian scholar 
H:who in 1749 acceded to the O'Conor seat
H:of Belnagare, County Roscommon. Although a country gentleman, he was a Catholic,
H:and thus was barred from many privileges of his class. He received a classical
H:education from a Franciscan friar and developed an interest in collecting Irish
H:manuscripts. O'Carolan was a frequent guest at his house.  A harp that reputedly 
H:belonged to O'Carolan remains with the family. Charles O'Conor's diaries of
H:1729 relate that he was taught songs on the harp by O'Carolan (then aged 59)
H:when the bard stayed a fortnight at Belnagare.
