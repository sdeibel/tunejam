T:Coleraine
C:jig
A:Traditional
O:Ireland
H:This tune is generally associated with Coleraine in Northern Ireland and apparently 
H:also some of the prejudices between different groups on one side or the other of that 
H:particular divide.  However, there is only one printed reference to the jig as being
H:Irish, and its long association with New England contra dancing may indicate it
H:originated there.  The town of Coleraine in Massachusetts (also Colrain) was first 
H:settled by a colony from the north of Ireland, about the year 1736, so in a sense 
H:both may be true.
