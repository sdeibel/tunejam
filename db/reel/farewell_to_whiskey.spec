T:Farewell to Whisky
C:polka
O:Scotland
A:Neil Gow
H:This is a lament written in the late 1700's for the closing of the Whisky distilleries in
H:Scotland. It may also be played as a slow air. The forbidding of distilling whisky was
H:due to a national grain shortage at the time, but the ban was subsequently lifted. Whisky
H:was required for births, weddings and funerals so Scots often buried stores for
H:forthcoming ceremonies. There is a story in Glenlyon of a man who emigrated, forgetting
H:his whisky.  He wrote back saying where it was buried but they never found it, or so they
H:claimed.
