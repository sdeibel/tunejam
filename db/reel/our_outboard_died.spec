T:Our Outboard Motor Died But We Got Saved
C:reel
A:Stephan Deibel
O:USA - Cambridge NY
H:This tune was written by Cambridge NY fiddler Stephan Deibel, around 2010 on a wilderness 
H:island in Blue Mountain Lake, NY. "While 
H:I was writing the tune, a boating party in a beautiful old wooden boat happened by.  Suddenly, 
H:their outboard motor stopped and they were unable to restart it.  There was a moment of 
H:tension as they drifted towards some sharp rocks, but they were saved just in time by 
H:another passing boater, and towed safely home.  The first part of this tune seems to 
H:imitate the attempts to restart the motor, and the second part their joy at being
H:saved, although this was not by conscious design."
