H:This was originally titled "Seals and Sky" and was written September 2015 on 
H:Janvrin's Island, a place with many seals and much sky that is off Isle 
H:Madam in the southeast corner of Cape Breton.  The author, however, was just
H:visiting and lives in Cambridge NY so it is not a real Cape Breton tune.
