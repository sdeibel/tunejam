T:Road to Boston
C:march,polka
O:USA - New England
A:Traditional
H:This is an older fifer's march that was played by American military musicians in the
H:Revolutionary War. The melody can be found in multiple 18th century music manuscripts. One
H:copy book by Thomas Nixon Jr. (1762-1842) of Framingham Connecticut included it as "March
H:to Boston.” Nixon was a thirteen-year-old who accompanied his father to the battles of
H:Lexington and Concord. Road to Boston was one of the most popular tunes during the
H:revolution, until American musicians picked up Yankee Doodle and The White Cockade by
H:hearing British troops playing them in the distance. There is a possibility that Road to
H:Boston was acquired in the same way, via a similar English tune named Road to 
H:London.  But, hey, we won the war.
