A:Traditional
H:This 4-part reel was first published in Dublin in 1795 in a gentleman's literary journal called
H:Walker's Hibernian, and around the same time by Dublin publisher T. Cooke in Tracyâ€™s
H:Selection of the Present Favorite Country Dances.  However, it may predate these 
H:sources.  In rural New York state, Opera Reel remained a favorite tune and dance into
H:the 20th century.  It was still performed at house dances in the central part of the 
H:state in the 1930's.
