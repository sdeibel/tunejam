T:Riding on a Load of Hay
C:polka
O:Ireland
A:Traditional
H:This tune is similar to a West Kerry polka called Port DÃ¡laig, named after the musician 
H:who played it, so it may originate from that area.  However, it may have been based on 
H:a strathspey named Mrs. Ramsey of Barnton that was composed in 1794 by Scottish 
H:dancing master and musician Duncan MacIntyre (1767-1807).
