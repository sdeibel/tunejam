T:Old French
C:reel
O:Canada - Quebec
A:Traditional
H:The original provenance of this tune is in Québécois repertoire, where it was recorded in 1929 by
H:by Sotère Mongrain (fiddle) and Ida Mongrain (piano) under the title "Reel de St-Tite." 
H:The tune was also in Maritime fiddler Don Messer's "Down-East" repertoire, as Rambler's 
H:Hornpipe.  The Old French title supposedly camed from a remark by an old Vermont fiddler 
H:who was asked its title and responded that it was "just an old French tune."
