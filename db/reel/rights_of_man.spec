T:Rights of Man
C:hornpipe,reel
O:Ireland
A:Traditional
H:The Northumbrian composer and fiddler James Hill (1811â€“1853) is sometimes credited as 
H:author of this tune, but this is disputed.  The tune is probably named for Thomas Paine's 
H:1791 book The Rights of Man, which sold a phenomenal 200,000 copies in England at
H:the time.  It was controversial because of its support of the revolution, was banned
H:by Royal proclamation, and often burned along with effigies of its author.  However,
H:the book continued to circulate widely, particularly in oppressed areas like Scotland and 
H:Ireland.  The tune is usually played as a hornpipe, but it may be played more like
H:a reel, as was done after the tune Crossing to Ireland by legendary Cape Breton 
H:fiddler Winston "Scotty" Fitzgerald (1914-1987), on this Classic Cuts album.
