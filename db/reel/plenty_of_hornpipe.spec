O:Canada - Nova Scotia
A:Stan Rogers
H:This is a tune written by Canadian songwriter Stan Rogers for his CD "Fogartyâ€™s Cove."
H:Despite the name, it is not a hornpipe.  Although Stan Rogers lived in Ontario, this
H:tune comes from a CD that commemorates the Canadian Maritimes, as inspired by Stan's
H:summers in Nova Scotia.  Stan died at age 33 in Cincinnati, Ohio, as the result of
H:an airplane fire.
