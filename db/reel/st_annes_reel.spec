T:Saint Anne's Reel (Reel des Esquimaults)
C:reel
O:Canada - Quebec
A:Traditional
H:This tune was first recorded by Montreal fiddler Joseph Allard (1873-1947) in 1930 as
H:Reel des Esquimaults (Reel of the Eskimos). There is no proof of the tune's exact origins
H:and there are many places named after St. Anne in French Canada, including some
H:associated with Eskimos. However, researcher Jean Duval believes the title refers to the
H:municipality of Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue at the western end of the island of Montreal. St.
H:Anne was the grandmother of Jesus, and is credited for many healing miracles, including at
H:the Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupr√© near Quebec City, which has several relics of the
H:saint and is one of the most significant Catholic pilgrimage sites in North America. The
H:importance of St. Anne in French Canadian culture certainly makes it possible that the 
H:tune was named not for a place, but for the saint herself.
