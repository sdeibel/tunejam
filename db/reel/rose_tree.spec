T:Rose Tree
C:march,polka
O:Uncertain
A:Traditional
H:The title of this tune comes from its use for a song called A Rose Tree in Full Bearing,
H:written in 1782 by John O'Keefe, for English composer William Shield's opera The Poor
H:Soldier. O'Keefe did not compose the melody, but adapted it from an older
H:tune, possibly Irish or Scottish. The melody appears in a music copy-book of Henry Livingston,
H:Jr. who in 1771 purchased the estate of Locust Grove in Poughkeepsie, New York and in 1775
H:participated in Montgomeryâ€™s failed attempt to take Montreal from the British.
