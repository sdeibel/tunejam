T: Red Haired Boy
C:reel,hornpipe
O:Ireland
A:Traditional
H:This tune is also known as The Jolly Beggarman, Little Beggarman, An Giolla Ruadh,
H:and by many other names.  It was first published in the mid 19th century and is 
H:generally thought to commemorate a real-life rogue and bandit.  It
H:appears in a story about uilleann piper Donnchadh Ó Sé from Lóthar, who once heard a
H:different tune being played by faeries at Faill an Mhada Rua.  He learned the faerie's
H:tune and found that each time he played it he would become ill for three months.  Some
H:time later, a rogue demanded him at gun point to play the faerie tune, but he got away 
H:with playing Red Haired Boy instead.  It is widely known, has been picked up by the 
H:American old time and bluegrass communities, and is often played somewhat 
H:like a hornpipe.
