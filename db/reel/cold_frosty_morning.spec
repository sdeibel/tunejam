T:Cold Frosty Morning
C:reel
A:Traditional
O:Scotland
H:This tune was written to commemorate the battle of Culloden Moor, Scotland.
H:On the very bloody morning of April 16, 1746, 8,000 English troops massacred a Scottish
H:army of 7,000, thus ending the Jacobite Rebellion in Scotland.  Some sources instead 
H:give an Appalachian origin to this tune, but it seems likely the tune migrated 
H:with the Scots that settled the area.  There are a number of other unrelated tunes
H:with the same name.
