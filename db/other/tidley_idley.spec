H:This tune was inspired by the children's book Burt Down Deep Water Man,
H:written by Robert McClosky.  The Tidley-Idley is Burt's boat, which he 
H:and his pet seagull take on an adventure at sea that involves sheltering 
H:from a storm inside the stomach of a friendly whale.  This tune was
H:inspired by the rhythym and sound of the Tidley-Idley's make-n-break engine.
