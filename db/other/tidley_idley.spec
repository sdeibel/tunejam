T:The Tidley-Idley
A:Stephan Deibel
O:USA - Cambridge NY
H:This tune was written by Cambridge NY fiddler Stephan Deibel.  It was inspired by the 1963
H:children's book Burt Dow Deep Water Man, by 
H:Robert McClosky.  "As a child, I checked this book out of the library so often that they 
H:eventually just gave it to me.  The Tidley-Idley is Burt's boat, which he and his pet 
H:seagull take on an adventure that involves sheltering from a storm inside the 
H:stomach of a friendly whale, among other delightful McCloskyisms.  The tune mimics how I 
H:imagine the rhythym and sound of the Tidley-Idley's make-n-break engine."
