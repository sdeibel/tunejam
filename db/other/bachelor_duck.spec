H:This tune was inspired by and written for the last two ducks that were left over from a 
H:larger flock we kept up to around 2012.  Both of these survivors were male, and both
H:always seemed irrepressibly jolly as they greeted us each day.  A variation starts the 
H:first time through the tune one octave lower than written.
