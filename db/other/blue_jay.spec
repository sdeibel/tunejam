O:USA - Cambridge NY
H:This tune was written in September 2015, during a visit to Prince Edward Island, where
H:we stayed for two weeks in a house in New Caledonia.  This house came with a square 
H:mile of land and trails.  One sunny day, I was out in a field in the beautiful country 
H:side, practicing the fiddle, when I began to mimic the call of some nearby bluejays.  
H:This imitation became the basis for a simple melody.
