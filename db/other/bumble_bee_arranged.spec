H:This was written on my back porch in early summer 2015, on a warm day when the air was 
H:heavy with bumblebees.  It was my first imitative tune, inspired by traditional tunes 
H:that mimic the sound of an animal as part of their melody, for example <i>The Yowe Cam 
H:to Wir Door Yarmin</i> from Shetland.  This arrangement was developed a few years
H:later, with an added C part.
