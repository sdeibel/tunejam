C:reel
O:Scotland
A:Traditional
H:This tune is probably of early 19th century Scottish origin.  It may be descended
H:from Fairy Dance, which is in turn a version of Nathaniel Gow's 1809 tune 
H:Largo's Fairy Dance.  It was also present in Ireland early in its history.
H:There are several other unrelated musical compositions that use the same name,
H:including a hornpipe and a ballad.
