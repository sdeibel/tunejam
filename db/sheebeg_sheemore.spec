T:Sheebeg Sheemore (Sí Bheag Sí Mhór)
C:waltz
O:Ireland
A:Turlough O'Carolan
H:Although played as a waltz now, this was written as an air before waltzes even existed,
H:by legendary blind Irish harpist Turlough O'Carolan (1670-1738). It appears to be an
H:adaptation and expansion of an older piece called An Chuaichín Mhaiseach (The Bonny
H:Cuckoo). It was probably O'Carolan's first composition, while he lived at the house of his
H:first patron Squire George Reynolds of Lough Scur at Letterfain in County Leitrim.
H:Reynolds was himself a harper and poet, and he encouraged O'Carolan to work on his
H:composition skills. The inspiration for the tune was a story told to O'Carolan by Reynolds
H:about Sí Bheag and Sí Mhór, two faerie mounds located near Lough Scur. According to
H:legend, these mounds were the site of a great faerie battle, resulting in the defeat of
H:Finn McCool and his Fianna. The mounds were said to have been topped by ancient ruins,
H:with fairy castles underneath where fallen heroes from the war were buried. These castles
H:were part of the underground world into which the supernatural race Tuatha Dé (later
H:called Aos Sí) retreated by treaty with the invading Milesians, who became the modern
H:Irish people. The fairy mounds were likely ancient conical heaps of stones and earth
H:called motes or raths, built in the Neolithic for ritual and/or burial purposes. Thus, the
H:story may be a connection to events that occurred in prehistory. Squire Reynolds is
H:supposed to have been much pleased by the composition, as have many people since.
