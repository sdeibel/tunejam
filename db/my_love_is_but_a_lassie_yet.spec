A:Traditional
H:The title of this tune comes from two songs written for it by Robert Burns and James 
H:Hogg, but the tune itself is much older.  It first appeared in print in Bremner's Scots 
H:Reels of 1757 as Miss Farquharson's Reel, and has history going at least as far back as
H:the 17th century.
