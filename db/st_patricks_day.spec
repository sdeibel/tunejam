C:jig,air
O:Ireland
A:Traditional
H:This tune was published in The Hibernian Muse (London, 1787, No. 52, p. 32).  The
H:collection included "the most Favorite Compositions of Carolan, The Celebrated Irish 
H:Bard," but it seems unlikely that he wrote this one.  St. Patrick was a 5th century
H:missionary, and has been the patron saint of Ireland since the 7th century.
