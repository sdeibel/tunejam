C:reel
K:G
O:Shetland
H:This is a Shetland reel brought to Cambridge NY by fiddler and flutist Bliss McIntosh, who studied
H:in the Shetland Islands in the summer of 1974, but does not otherwise seem to have entered
H:documented North American traditional music circles.  It appeared on the album Shetland 
H:Fiddlers on Stage (leader Tom Anderson).  The A part has words as follows:
H:<br><br>
H:Canna get my mare tamed<br>Peerie shugie, bonnie shugie,<br>Canna get my mare tamed<br>
H:What shall I do?<br><br>
H:Tame her when the snaw (snow) comes<br>Peerie shugie, bonnie shugie,<br>
H:Tame her when the snaw comes<br>That’s what you’ll do.
