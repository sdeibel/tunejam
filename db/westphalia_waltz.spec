T:Westphalia Waltz
C:waltz
O:USA - Texas
A:Cotton Collins
H:This tune was adapted into its current form and renamed in 1946 by fiddler Cotton
H:Collins, who lived in Westphalia Texas. He may have heard a version it in Germany during
H:World War Two, or perhaps in nearby Bremond, which was a Polish community. The bawdy
H:1920's Polish song called Pytala Sie Panii, "what she said" or "what she asked," uses the
H:melody, and as does Wszystkie Rybki, which was later loosely translated as Dreamy Fish
H:Waltz. Unsurprisingly, there may be even older precursors, perhaps as far back as midevil
H:France. Joe Weed directed a documentary called Westphalia Waltz Story that is available on DVD.
