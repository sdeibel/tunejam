T:Reel Beatrice
C:reel
O:Italy
A:Traditional
H:This tune was popularized in Quebec by fiddler Joseph Bouchard (1905-1979),
H:who recorded in in 1938, and later by Chicago Irish-American fiddler Liz Carroll.
H:However, it originates from a polka called Oggi Nevica from the Italian
H:Ballo Liscio dance repertoire.  It may have earlier variants and is in 
H:the style of a 19th century bal musette, with two parts in a minor key and the
H:third in the corresponding major key.  It is still popular in 
H:the Emilia Romagna region of northeastern Italy.  Joseph Bouchard's original name for 
H:the tune appears to be Reel p'tit Charles.  The name of the tune on the B side of his 
H:1938 recording was Reel Beatrice and this was somehow later confused and became the
H:commonly used name of the tune.
