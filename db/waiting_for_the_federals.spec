O:USA - Midwest
A:Traditional
H:This is an "old time" tune closely related to Seneca Square Dance, which originated from the Oklahoma or
H:Missouri area.  It may be named for the population of Senecas that were resettled to Oklahoma after the 
H:war of 1812, or it could be named for Seneca, Missouri.  It was first recorded in 1926 by Sam Long (1876-1931),
H:who lived in both these areas.  The Southern US name for the tune, Waiting for the Federals, is likely a 
H:reference to an event in the American Civil War.
