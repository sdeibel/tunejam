T:Spootiskerry
C:reel
A:Samuel Ian Rothmar Burns
O:Shetland
H:This reel was the first tune ever written by Shetland fiddler Samuel Ian Rothmar Burns,
H:probably around 1960. Spootiskerry is the name of a farm in the author's family. In his
H:tunebook, also called Spootiskerry, he says "Spootiskerry [is] the croft belonging to
H:my late grand aunts, Bella and Joan Nicolson, situated between the village of Sullom, and
H:the new town of Brae." A spoot is a razor clam, one of the edible "ebb meats" taken from the
H:shore at low tide, named because it "spoots" (or spouts) when you disturb it. A skerry
H:is a group of rocks which are only sometimes visible at low tide.
