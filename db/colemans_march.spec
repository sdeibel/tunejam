T:Coleman's March
C:march
O:USA - Midwest
A:Traditional
H:This tune originated in south-central Kentucky. It is associated with the hanging of
H:fiddler Joe Coleman, who was accused of murdering his wife in 1899, near the town of Slate
H:Fork in Adair County, Kentucky. He claimed innocence but was convicted on circumstantial
H:evidence and the testimony of a sister-in-law. As he was driven to the gallows, he sat on
H:his coffin and played this tune. Some versions of the story claim Coleman's family was
H:able to quickly recover his body after the hanging, somehow managed to revive him, and
H:brought him to a steamboat heading down the Cumberland River, by which he disappeared into
H:the West.
