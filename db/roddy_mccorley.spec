T:Roddy McCorley
C:march
O:Ireland
A:Traditional
H:This tune commemorates Roddy McCorley, who (probably) participated in the 1798
H:United Irishmen rebellion and subsequently lived as an outlaw with the patriotic
H:Archer Gang. He was hung in 1800 for his activities with this gang, after
H:being betrayed by an informant. There are two songs named Roddy McCorley, one from 1798
H:and another from the 1890's. Other than perhaps the earlier of these two, there is
H:no contemporary evidence of McCorley's involvement in the rebellion.  It is known, 
H:however, that a few years before the rebellion Roddy's father was executed for stealing
H:sheep.  This charge may have been politically motivated, and thus a strong reason
H:for Roddy to participate in a rebellion.
