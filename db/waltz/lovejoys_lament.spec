T:Lovejoy's Lament
A:Stephan Deibel
O:Cambridge NY
H:This is the first tune I ever wrote, in 2008,  while sitting on my back porch,
H:which overlooks the Lovejoy Plow Factory in Cambridge NY.  Starting in around
H:1850, this factory produced the Cambridge Steel Plow, which was significant 
H:because it opened up the thick sods in the midwest to larger-scale farming,
H:ultimately putting many upstate New York farmers out of business.
