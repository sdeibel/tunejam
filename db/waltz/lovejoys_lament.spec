T:Lovejoy's Lament
A:Stephan Deibel
O:Cambridge NY
H:This is the first tune I ever wrote, in 2008, while sitting on my back porch, which
H:overlooks the Lovejoy Plow Factory in Cambridge NY.  Starting in around 1850, this 
H:factory produced the Cambridge Steel Plow, which was significant because it opened up 
H:the thick sods in the midwest to larger-scale farming.  Ultimately, this put many 
H:upstate New York farmers out of business, something that perhaps Mr. Lovejoy would have
H:lamented later in life.  It is, however, musically a waltz and not a lament.
