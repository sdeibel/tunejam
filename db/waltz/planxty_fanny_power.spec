T:Planxty Fanny Power
C:waltz
O:Ireland
A:Turlough O'Carolan
H:This tune was composed before 1728 by blind Irish harper Turlough O'Carolan
H:(1670–1738). It was written as an air; waltzes did not yet exist. The tune and words of
H:the song that went with it were dedicated to Frances, the daughter of O'Carolan's patrons
H:David and Elizabeth Power of Coorheen in Loughrea, County Galway. She was long-lived and
H:survived until 1793. One of the few female harpers of that time, Rose Mooney
H:(1740–1798), played this tune at the Belfast Harp Festival in 1792. Like many musicians
H:then, she was also blind. She and her servant Mary happened to be in Killala in County
H:Mayo in 1798, at the time that the French were landing in support of the Rising. After the
H:British troops took flight, Ms. Mooney was caught up in the ensuing celebrations to the
H:point that she drank herself to death.
