T:Crested Hens (Les Poules Huppées)
C:waltz
A:Gilles Chabenat
O:France - Central
H:Although this tune is often mistakenly thought to be an ancient Breton tune, it was 
H:actually written by Gilles Chabenat in 1983.  He wrote it on a hurdy gurdy as
H:a "bourrée à trois temps" (3/8 time), and thus was originally played much faster than 
H:most people play it now.  Gilles stated that some bars of a Debussy composition served 
H:as inspiration and explained the title as follows: "I was 15 and couldn’t decide on a title.  
H:One day we were playing at oxymorons and my friend said "Poulles Huppées" we all laughed 
H:at that for a long time, so I decided to name the tune that. I know it’s a dumb title, 
H:but we were just dumb kids."
