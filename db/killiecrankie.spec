T:Killiecrankie
C:march,air
O:Scotland
A:Thomas Connellan
H:This was written by Thomas Connellan, an Irish harpist who spent time in
H:Scotland.  It was named after the battle of Killiecrankie in 1698, which was part of
H:the Jacobite Uprising.  Killiecrankie means "wood of the aspens."  The tune is also 
H:known as Planxty Davis, although this may stem from confusion with an O'Carolan tune, 
H:due to the similar sounding last names of the two composers.  The version here came 
H:from fiddler Marc Boudreau, who lives on Isle Madame, off Cape Breton.
