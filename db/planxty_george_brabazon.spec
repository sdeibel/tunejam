T:Planxty George Brabazon
C:reel
O:Ireland
A:Turlough O'Carolan
H:This tune is generally thought to have been composed by Irish harper Turlough O'Carolan
H:(1670-1738). It was dedicated to George Brabazon, a young bachelor. The first printed
H:evidence for its being composed by O'Carolan is in Captain Francis O’Neill’s 1950
H:Complete Collection. Some question whether this attribution is correct, although
H:stylistically it could be O'Carolan's.
