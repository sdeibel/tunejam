T:Sweets of May
C:jig
O:Ireland
A:Traditional
H:This three part jig is based on an earlier two-part tune called Follow Me Down To
H:Carlow, which is said to have been been played publicly for the first time in 1580 by the Irish war-pipers
H:of Feagh MacHugh (Fiach McHugh O'Byrne) at the battle of Glenmalure. However, the tune may
H:not be nearly that old, and its first publication was in the mid 19th century.  There
H:is an early 19th century dance of the same name from Armagh that is said to have been 
H:inspired by the dancing of the fairies on May Eve.  The tune is used for the annual 
H:Maypole dance in Cambridge NY.
