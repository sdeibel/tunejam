T:Arran Boat Song
C:air,jig
A:Traditional
O:Scotland
H:This tune was first published as The Arran Boat Song around 1875 in James Kerr's first
H:Merry Melodies volume. Is is named after the Scottish Arran Islands and not the Irish Aran
H:Islands, and is usually played as an air and not a jig. It is also known as The Highland
H:Boat Song and Queen Maryâ€™s Escape From Loch Leven Castle.  The latter is a song that commemorates
H:the escape of Mary, Queen of Scots, from Loch Leven Castle in 1568, which "involved
H:drugging half the island with hearty doses of wine whilst young Willie Douglas pegged all
H:the boats to the shore bar one."  See the last link below for the details.
