T:Bear Dance #2
C:march
K:Am
A:Traditional
H:This is the second part of a Belgian tune called Krebbel.  It is also called
H:Berendans in southern Holland, and may have older eastern European or
H:Gypsy roots.  Locally, this tune is played after Bear Dance #1,
H:but elsewhere the order is sometimes reversed.  Some local groups play a different 
H:subset, consisting of the A part of Bear Dance #2 followed the A part of Bear 
H:Dance #1.  There is also a third Bear Dance that serves as an introduction and 
H:tag ending, and many other similar versions of part of all of these tunes.
